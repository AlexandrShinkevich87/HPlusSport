Web Development. Java EE: Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)

MVC architecture:
View - JSP or HTML files
Controller - servlet (component) classes that intercept request, and prepare the response
Model - data of the application.
DAO - design pattern called data access object. A class is going to hold all the methods to connect to the database and do all the transactions.
Tables to be used:
Users - to store all user information
Products - to store all product-related information
Orders - to store order history of a particular user

Types of HTTP Requests
GET - get or retrieve information from the server side
POST - process or manipulate information on the server side (change the data on the server side)
PUT - upload the definition of a resource on the server. 
DELETE - delete a resource from the server
HEAD - same as a get request, but returns with the header information, not the body of the response. 
OPTIONS - helps trace what HTTP methods work on the server, as in what are the possible options that you can run on the target resource.
